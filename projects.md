## LiveHD

Projects for [LiveHD](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd). Lead Mentors: Jose Renau <mailto:renau@ucsc.edu> and Sheng-Hong Wang <mailto:swang203@ucsc.edu>

### Tree sitter Pyrope

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Tree-sitter Pyrope  |
| Description | Work on a tree-sitter grammar for Pyrope |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17, Parsing |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#tree-sitter-pyrope)

Using [https://github.com/tekinengin/tree-sitter-pyrope](https://github.com/tekinengin/tree-sitter-pyrope) as a starting point, complete the Pyrope grammar
to correctly parse the [Pyrope grammar](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/pyrope.html), interface with LiveHD
and third party tools.

Main features:

* Pyrope tree-sitter grammar
* tree-sitter to LNAST generation (Comparable to https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/tree/master/inou/pyrope)
* Atom and neovim integration
* Atom go definition, highlight, and attribute
* Atom capacity to query LNAST/Lgraph generated grammar for bit-width. The incremental grammar passed to LNAST, passed to Lgraph,
  and incremental bit-width inference.
* neovim highlight, indent, fold support
* Integrate with atom-hide as extra language

In addition to the packages, there should be an iterator that use the incremental builder to support incremental changes.


### Mockturtle

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Mockturtle |
| Description | Perform synthesis for graph in LiveHD using Mockturtle |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17, synthesis |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#mockturtle)

There are some issues with Mockturtle integration (new cells) and it is not using the latest Mockturtle library versions.
The goal is to use Mockturtle (https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle) with LiveHD. The main characteristics:

* Use mockturtle to tmap to LUTs
* Use mockturtle to synthesize (optimize) logic
* Enable cut-rewrite as an option
* Enable hierarchy cross optimization (hier:true option)
* Use the graph labeling to find cluster to optimize
* Re-timing
* Map to LUTs only gates and non-wide arithmetic. E.g: 32bit add is not mapped to LUTS, but a 2-bit add is mapped.
* List of resources to not map:
    * Large ALUs. Large ALUs should have an OpenWare block (hardcoded in FPGAs and advanced adder options in ASIC)
    * Multipliers and dividers
    * Barrell shifters with not trivial shifts (1-2 bits) selectable at run-time
    * memories, luts

### Query Shell

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Query Shell |
| Description | Create a console app that interacts with LiveHD to query parameters about designs |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#query-shell-not-lgshell-to-query-graphs)

* Based on replxx (like lgshell)
* Query bits, ports...  like
    * https://github.com/rubund/netlist-analyzer
    * https://www.jameswhanlon.com/querying-logical-paths-in-a-verilog-design.html
* It would be cool if subsections (selected) parts can be visualized with something like https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg
* The shell may be expanded to support simulation in the future
* Wavedrom/Duh dumps

Wavedrom and duh allows to dump bitfield information for structures. It would be interesting to explore to dump tables and bit
fields for Lgraph IOs, and structs/fields inside the module. It may be a way to integrate with the documentation generation.

Example of queries: show path, show driver/sink of, do topo traversal,....

As an interesting extension would be to have some simple embedded language (TCL or ChaiScript or ???) to control queries more
easily and allow to build functions/libraries.

### Lgraph and LNAST check pass

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Lgraph and LNAST check pass |
| Description | Create a pass that check the integrity/correctness of Lgraph and LNAST |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#lgraph-and-lnast-check-pass)

Create a pass that checks that the Lgraph (and/or LNAST) is semantically
correct. The LNAST already has quite a few tests (pass.semantic), but it can be
further expanded. Some checks:

* No combinational loops
* No mismatch in bit widths
* No disconnected nodes
* Check for inefficient splits (do not split buses that can be combined)
* Transformations stages should not drop names if same net is preserved
* No writes in LNAST that are never read
* All the edges are possible. E.g: no pin 'C' in Sum_op


### Terminal record replay

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Terminal record/replay |
| Description | Record terminal commands and have the capacity to replay for testing and performance |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#term-recordreplay-for-benchmarkingtesting)

Use automatic asciinema generation. Compare the test speed and summarize the
performance difference from "a user" point of view. The results should allow to
track performance changes. These are integration tests that should be used for
overall performance and correctness. The same tests can be used as "demo" to
explain how to use the flow.

Maybe expand tmt_test and main_test to be a more stand-alone testing setup.


### OS X Alpine Linux Support

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | OS X, Alpine Linux Support |
| Description | LiveHD has issues with non-linux setups like OS X and Alpine Linux |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#os-x-alpine-linux-support)

LiveHD compiles (it did) with OS X, but there are some issues with the mmap
infrastructure inside mmap_lib. The code functionality should be able to run
(the mmap_remap does not exist in OS X, but a more costly alternative is
implemented for OS X, just not tested
and it seems faulty).

There are different set of issues with the alpine Linux distribution. Alpine
Linux does not use libc, and there are some failures. It would be good to fix
them all.

### Random CHISEL Verilog Pyrope generator

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Random CHISEL/Verilog/Pyrope generator |
| Description | Create a random program generator that generates the same program for multiple languages |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#random-chiselverilogpyrope-generator)

Create a python/ruby/C++ program that generates pseudo-random programs in
several languages (CHISEL/Verilog/Pyrope). The idea is that the same program
can be implemented in multiple ways but all should have the same result
(simulation and LEC).

### unbitwidth

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | unbitwidth |
| Description | Not all the variables need bitwidth information. Find the small subset |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#unbitwidth-local-and-global-bitwidth)

This pass is needed to create less verbose CHISEL and Pyrope code generation.

The LGraph can have bitwidth information for each dpin. This is needed for
Verilog code generation, but not needed for Pyrope or CHISEL.  CHISEL can
perform local bitwidth inference and Pyrope can perform global bitwidth
inference.

A new pass should remove redundant bitwidth information. The information is
redundant because the pass/bitwidth can regenerate it if there is enough
details. The goal is to create a pass/unbitwidth that removes either local or
global bitwidth. The information left should be enough for the bitwidth pass to
regenerate it.

* Local bitwidth: It is possible to leave the bitwidth information in many
places and it will have the same results, but for CHISEL the inputs should be
sized. The storage (memories/flops) should have bitwidth when can not be
inferred from the inputs.

* Global bitwidth: Pyrope bitwidth inference goes across the call hierarchy.
This means that a module could have no bitwidth information at all. We start
from the leave nodes. If all the bits can be inferred given the inputs, the
module should have no bitwidth. In that case the bitwidth can be inferred from
outside.

### gRPC Client

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | gRPC Client |
| Description | Allow LiveHD to submit gRPC (bazel) jobs to distributed computing |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#grpc-client)

Leverage the gRPC client in liveHD to allow the submission of work to remote servers.

Once we can submit gRPC from inside LiveHD, we should have to re-structure the
pass API to have a gRPC call for each of the main steps.

### LNAST Opt

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | LNAST Opt |
| Description | Perform copy propagation, constant folding, and dce at LNAST level |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#lnast-opt)

In LiveHD, LGraph has the cprop pass that performs constant folding, copy
propagation, strength reduction... and many other optimizations.


It may be useful to have a copy propagation, constant folding, and dead code
elimination in LNAST. There are several reasons:

* Doing code simplification early (LNAST is the earliest) reduces workload/steps in successive passes.
* The simulation saves checkpoints, a LNAST Opt without dead code elimination would be useful to create the intermediate values for debugging.

## Eusocial Storage Devices

As storage devices get faster, data management tasks rob the host of CPU cycles and main memory bandwidth. The [Eusocial project](https://cross.ucsc.edu/projects/eusocialpage.html) aims to create a new interface to storage devices that can leverage existing and new CPU and main memory resources to take over data management tasks like availability, recovery, and migrations. The project refers to these storage devices as “eusocial” because we are inspired by eusocial insects like ants, termites, and bees, which as individuals are primitive but collectively accomplish amazing things.

### Evaluating user space networking stacks on SmartNICs

 - **Skills:** C, Bash, performance evaluation tools (Linux perf, SystemTap, etc.)
 - **Difficulty:** Easy
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

The BlueField DPU as an example of SmartNICs is available nowadays. However, the performance of the kernel networking stack on this device is known to involve expensive overhead. The alternatives are to use some user-space solutions such as DPDK (for TCP and RDMA) and libvma (for RDMA). Therefore, it would be interesting to evaluate the performance differences between the kernel and these user-space alternatives, especially focusing on characterizing the benefits for SmartNICs.

### Dynamic function injection for RocksDB

 - **Skills:** C/C++, Java
 - **Difficulty:** Challenging
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

Recent research reveals that the compaction process in RocksDB can be altered to optimize future data access by changing the data layout in compaction levels. The benefit of this approach can be extended to different data layout optimization based on application access patterns and requirements. In this project, we want to create an interface that would allow users to dynamically inject layout optimization functions to RockDB, using containerization technologies such as Webassembly.

### Demonstrating a composable storage system accelerated by memory semantic technologies

 - **Skills:** C/C++, Bash, Python, System architecture, Network fabrics
 - **Difficulty:** Challenging
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

Since the last decade, the slowing down in the performance improvement of general-purpose processors is driving the system architecture to be increasingly heterogeneous. We have seen the kinds of domain-specific accelerator hardware (e.g., FPAG, SmartNIC, TPU, GPU) are growing to take over many different jobs from the general-purpose processors. On the other hand, the network and storage device performance have been tremendously improved with a trajectory much outweighed than that of processors. With this trend, a natural thought to continuously scale the storage system performance economically is to efficiently utilize and share different sources from different nodes over the network. There already exist different resource sharing protocols like CCIX, CXL, and GEN-Z. Among these GEN-Z is the most interesting because, unlike RDMA, it enables remote memory accessing without exposing details to applications (i.e., not application changes). Therefore, it would be interesting to see how/whether these technologies can help improve the performance of storage systems, and to what extent. This project would require building a demo system that uses some of these technologies (especially GEN-Z) and run selected applications/workloads to better understand the benefits.

## Open Source Autonomous Vehicle Controller


The OSAVC is a vehicle-agnostic open source hardware and software project.  This project is designed to provide a real-time hardware controller adaptable to any vehicle type, suitable for aerial, terrestrial, marine, or extraterrestrial vehicles. It allows control researchers to develop state estimation algorithms, sensor calibration algorithms, and vehicle control models in a modular fashion such that once the hardware set has been developed switching algorithms requires only modifying one C function and recompiling.

Lead mentor: Aaron Hunter <mailto:aamuhunt@ucsc.edu>

Projects for the OSAVC:


### Vehicle/Craft sensor driver development
 - **Topics**: Driver code to integrate sensor to a microcontroller
 - **Skills**: C, I2C, SPI, UART interfaces
 - **Difficulty** Easy
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Help develop a sensor library for use in autonomnous vehicles.  Possible sensors include range finders, ping sensors, IMUs, GPS receivers, RC receivers, barometers, air speed sensors, etc. Code will be written in C using state machine methodology and non-blocking algorithms. Test the drivers on a Microchip microncontroller. 

### IMU calibration algorithm development
 - **Topics**: Least Squares, DCM, 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, Matlab/Simulink, numerical optimzation algorithms
 - **Difficulty** Medium

The IMU is a sensor comprising nine separate sensors in a single package, including acceleromeeters, gyroscopes, and magnetometer. Using a model for sensor errors, develop calibration algorithms that characterize these errors and provide optimal estimates of the true sensor reading.  Provide an algorithm in C or Python to implement this efficiently on a microcontroller or single board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

### Path finding algorithm using OpenCV
 - **Topics**: Computer vision, blob detection 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, OpenCV
 - **Difficulty** Medium
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Use OpenCV to identify a track for an autonomous vehicle to follow.  For example, a closed circuit course for an autonomous race car might be demarcated by different colored cones indicating the left and right boundaries of the track.  Use OpenCV to find and track the location of these cones as the car navigates the course. Implement initially on a laptop using video frames.  Ideally, transfer the algorithm to a Raspberry Pi and test on a real track.


### State estimation/sensor fusion algorithm development
 - **Topics**: Kalman filtering, Mahoney 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, Matlab/Simulink, numerical optimzation algorithms
 - **Difficulty** Challenging
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Implement an optimal state estimation algorithm from a model.  This model can be derived from a Kalman filter or some other state estimation filter (e.g., Mahoney filter).  THe model takes sensor readings as input and provides an estimate of the state of a vehicle. Finally, convert the model to standard C using the Simulink code generation or implement in Python (for use on a single board computer, e.g., Raspberry Pi)

### Vehicle dynamic model development

## SkyhookDM

[SkyhookDM](http://www.skyhookdm.com)

The Skyhook Data Management project extends object storage with data 
management functionality for tabular data. SkyhookDM enables storing and query 
database tables in Ceph distributed object storage.  SkyhookDM is an 
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) native 
storage system that utilizes the Arrow Dataset API to store and query data,
and our Ceph extensions support server-side data processing. For example, 
pushing down SELECT, PROJECT and other functionality into storage to reduce 
data returned to the client.

-------------------

### Add Ability to create and save views from Datasets

  - **Topics**: `Arrow`, `Database views`, `virtual datasets`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)

Problem - Workloads may repeat the same or similar queries over time. This causes repetition of IO and compute operations, wasting resources.  
Saving previous computation in the form of materialized views can provide benefit for future
workload processing. 
Solution - Add a method to the Dataset API to create views from queries and save the view as an object in a separate pool with some object key that can be generated from the query that created it. 

Reference:
https://docs.dremio.com/working-with-datasets/virtual-datasets.html

### Ability to Push back query execution to the Client in case of overloaded OSDs

  - **Topics**: `Arrow`, `query opererators`, `push down computation`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
   
Problem - Currently, SkyhookDM v0.1.0 just allows pushing down Compute operations such as selection and projection into the Storage layer (i.e the Ceph Object Storage Devices). With a large number of clients trying to push down computation into the OSDs at a time, the CPU and Memory pressure of the OSDs may quickly increase causing run-time side effects such as blocked and slow OSD operations.  
Solution - We can modify the Dataset API by adding a method to check the resource utilization on the Storage side periodically and if the CPU and Memory usage passes a user-defined threshold or some other metrice, the Datasets API silently shifts to client side query execution for a while and then tries to push down again.  This method could also be applied dynamically at the OSD, allowing the OSD to reject certain operations, returning metadata concerning which operations have not yet been applied.

### Port wiki to ReadTheDocs or other documentation platform

  - **Topics**: `Documentation`, `wiki`, `markdown`
  - **Skills**: Markdown, documentation, html
  - **Difficulty**: Easy
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)

SkyhookDM's documentation is [currently written](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph/wiki)
as Github Wiki pages. We would like to move it to another platform such as 
[ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org), 
to reorganize it and rewrite some sections as part of this effort. 
[Github issue](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph-cls/issues/42).

### Integrating Delta Lake on top of SkyhookDM

  - **Topics**: `data lakes`, `lake house`, `distributed query processing`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is a new architecture for querying big data lakes through Spark, providing transactions.
An important benefit of this integration will be to provide an SQL interface for SkyhookDM functionality, through Spark SQL.
This project will further build upon our current work connecting Spark to SkyhookDM through the Arrow Dataset API.
This would allow us to run some of the TPC-DS queries (popular set of SQL queries for benchmarking databases) on SkyhookDM easily.

### Write Helm charts for easy deployment of the SkyhookDM, Dask , ServiceX stack on Kubernetes

  - **Topics**: `helm charts lakes`, `deployment`, `Dask`, `Kubernetes`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
Problem - In the IRIS-HEP DOMA project, SkyhookDM will be used to act as a lake house where data will be ingested from ServiceX. The Data stored in SkyhookDM will be processed by Coffea through several Dask workers. The deployment of this 3 layered end-to-end system is quite cumbersome and inefficient if done manually. Most importantly, it's a blockage to someone who would like to test out the entire system very quickly.

Solution - We can write Helm charts to easily deploy this end-to-end system on Kubernetes with just a few Helm commands. The goal is to deploy ServiceX, SkyhookDM, and Dask workers and ensure they can communicate with one another. We can expose the system to the end-users via a Jupyter notebook with some getting started code/guide.

### Facilitate continuous benchmarking/regression testing for the critical components of SkyhookDM

  - **Topics**: `helm charts lakes`, `deployment`, `Dask`, `Kubernetes`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
 
Problem - SkyhookDM,  which is a computational storage system built by embedding Apache Arrow is a performance critical distributed storage system. Often small changes in the performance critical parts of the source code can cause significant performance changes. It is very important to properly track these performance changes in order to allow the project to evolve more performant and prevent silent degradation in performance over time. 

Solution - We can use the Google benchmark framework to create benchmarks (very similar to unit tests) for all the performance critical parts of the source code. These benchmarks would be run on CI via Github workflows and would allow us to track the performance changes caused by every commit/pull request. We can also create a nice little web dashboard to visualize the performance results uploaded from the CI. But maybe this is another project on it’s own.

-------------------

### HDF5 - Apache Arrow Integration

  * **Topics**: `VOL connector`, `streaming data`, `column store`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5, Apache Arrow
  * **Difficulty**: Medium

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) creates in-memory column stores that can be used to manage streamed data.
Accessing this data through the HDF5 API would allow applications to take advantage of transient, column-oriented
data streams, such as realtime data from high-speed scientific instruments and cameras.  Bridging the gap between
science applications and analytics tools that use HDF5 and Apache Arrow data streams could bring new kinds of tools
and data together.  This project will create a standalone HDF5 [VOL connector](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer)
that allows applications to make HDF5 calls to access Apache Arrow data.

### HDF5 - Ceph RADOS Integration

  * **Topics**: `VOL connector`, `Ceph`, `object storage`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5, Ceph / RADOS
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

The [Ceph](https://ceph.io) distributed storage system provides object, block, and file system layer interfaces.
A prototype HDF5 [VOL connector](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer) has been developed
to access the [RADOS](https://ceph.io/geen-categorie/the-rados-distributed-object-store/) object storage layer, enabling
HDF5 objects (datasets, groups, etc) to be directly stored as RADOS objects.  This project would expand the capabilities
of this VOL connector, enabling HDF5 applications to store data directly in RADOS pools.

### Column-storage in HDF5

  * **Topics**: `HDF5`, `column-store`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5
  * **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Column-oriented storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) provides efficient access to fields within
records, across many rows.  Adding this storage method to HDF5 would dramatically improve performance for applications that
primarily access subsets of the fields in an HDF5 dataset.

### Sparse data storage in HDF5

  * **Topics**: `HDF5`, `sparse data`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5
  * **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) have applications in many fields within science and mathematics.
Storing and accesssing them in HDF5 is inefficient though, as HDF5 is currently optimized for storing dense arrays.
Adding efficient storage of sparse data in HDF5 would dramatically improve performance for applications that wish to store and
access sparse data.  This could extend beyond sparse matrices proper, and include any form of sparsely populated array or table.

### Metadata search in HDF5 with Database Solutions

  * **Topics**: `HDF5`, `search`, `index`, `database`
  * **Skills**: HDF5, Database Integration
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) excel at many tasks, one of which is content queries.
HDF5 does not currently have good methods for indexing and searching available to user applications, although protoyping work
has been performed in a [git branch](https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/projects/HDFFV/repos/hdf5/branches?base=feature%2Findexing).
Instead of adding index and query operations directly to HDF5, this project would instead connect a database package, such as
[RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org) or [VoltDB](https://www.voltdb.com), with HDF5 and perform query and index operations in the
database and array-oriented I/O with HDF5.

## [SkyhookDM](http://www.skyhookdm.com)/[Proactive Data Containers](https://sdm.lbl.gov/pdc/about.html) (PDC)

[Proactive Data Containers](https://sdm.lbl.gov/pdc/about.html) (PDC) are containers within a locus of storage (memory, NVRAM, disk, etc.) that store science data in an object-oriented manner.  Managing data as objects enables powerful optimization opportunities for data movement and 
transformations, and storage mechanisms that take advantage of the deep storage hierarchy and enable automated performance tuning

### PDC - Ceph RADOS Integration

  * **Topics**: `PDC`, `Ceph`, `object storage`
  * **Skills**: C, PDC, Ceph / RADOS
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

The [Ceph](https://ceph.io) distributed storage system provides object, block, and file system layer interfaces.
PDC has plugabble storage mechanisms and the [RADOS](https://ceph.io/geen-categorie/the-rados-distributed-object-store/) object storage layer
within Ceph is an ideal target for storing PDC objects.  This project would extend PDC to store its objects in RADOS pools.
